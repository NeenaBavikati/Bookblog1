  <p id="paragraph1">I chose to start this year off reading “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie. I chose to read this book before any other books mainly because I have been meaning to read it for a while now, but I had just never gotten around to it. Additionally, the fact that this book is based off a movie called “Murder on the Orient Express” which is a movie I had been dying to see, made this all the more exciting to read.</p>
  <p id="paragraph2">I was originally given this book as a gift. After I saw that it was a mystery, my first thought was that I didn’t want to read it. Because of the fact that this book is of the genre “mystery”, I immediately assumed I would not like it. This is because I typically find mystery books boring, because although it is a mystery and it’s meant to leave you guessing, I feel like a lot of these types of books are too cliché and very predictable. However, the content of this book gave it a fighting chance. While it is true that I don’t like mysteries all that much, there are some exceptions. The idea of a group of people being killed off one by one with nowhere to run intrigues me because it’s interesting to see how everyone adjusts to the situation and to see the worst of each of these unique personalities. With a situation like this, things are always suspenseful and leaves me on the edge of my seat.</p>
  <p id="paragraph3">As of now, I am 7 chapters into this book. It is hard to make predictions as this book always leaves you guessing, regardless, I have made a few predictions. At this point in the book, two people have died, and they died the exact same way the soldiers in the nursery rhyme do. This is obviously no coincidence, but the evidence we are given shows us that no one else is on the island with them, leading me to believe that the deaths were planned. I believe whoever gathered them all there had set up all the traps in advance to their arrival.</p>
  <p id="paragraph4">Based on what I have read so far, I love this book! This book has managed to keep me at the edge of my seat for up to seven chapters. Additionally, I haven’t run into any clichés so far, and this book has proven itself to be far from predictable. In conclusion, considering all what I’ve read so far, I’d give this book 4/5 stars. The only reason I don’t give it 5/5 stars is because of the way that each chapter is cut into sections, it’s been kind of confusing.</p>
